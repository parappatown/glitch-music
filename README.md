Hacked during [Glitch Music Hack](http://monthlymusichackathon.org/post/106566964802/glitch) in January, 2015.

Using the cr8k percussion samples from [Roland 808/909/System100/JX3 (over 400 drum samples, 16 MB)](http://www.dave40.co.uk/1/VwSlAr.php?id=25)

Had fun exploring the [Ring Modulator](http://webaudio.prototyping.bbc.co.uk/ring-modulator/)
