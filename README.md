# glitch-music

Hacked during [Glitch Music Hack](http://monthlymusichackathon.org/post/106566964802/glitch) in January, 2015.

Using the cr8k percussion samples from [Roland 808/909/System100/JX3 (over 400 drum samples, 16 MB)](http://www.dave40.co.uk/1/VwSlAr.php?id=25)

Had fun exploring the [Ring Modulator](http://webaudio.prototyping.bbc.co.uk/ring-modulator/)

The project used [HTML5 Web Audio API] (http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/index.html) and [Makey Makey] (http://makeymakey.com/)

I was introduced to [Circuit Bending](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_bending) for musical compositions: [N0izmkr, aka Nicole Carroll](http://nicolecarrollmusic.com/about), [Notendo, aka Jeff Donaldson](http://notendo.com/), [Glitch Cake](http://glitchcake.com/)

# The hack

We used the Web Audio API to create pure tones, then to *glitch* it, we added a couple of variables: percentage range from the *true* frequency, and how often we switch to the next random frequency (in milliseconds).

We also used the Makey Makey (my first time opening the box, yeah!). Caroline brought tin foil, speakers, and 3 TAB's soft drink soda cans. We used a textarea for handling the keyboard input of the Makey Makey.

I added a small scale of 7 notes, though we knew we only had 5 inputs for the Makey Makey (if we ignore the 'click' input). The randomness was pretty good, but I felt it was missing a rythm or something melodic to accompany the glitch. So I looked into some drum samples and hooked up to the interface.
